This is a SHA256 an SHA512 implementation.

The focus of this project is to create an optimized code for IBM POWER
architecture, especifically using ABI v2 (Little Endian).

This is a generic project and self-contained now. We are going to start
backporting it to different projects. Our initial target is OpenJDK.
